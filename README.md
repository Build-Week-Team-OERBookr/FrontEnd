# Proposal

---

- What problem does your app solve?

It makes it easy to find open licensed text books that are peer reviewed. 

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

Creates a localized space for teachers to use as an open resource for open licensed text books. 

- What is the mission statement?

We do our best to provide teachers a source for open licensed text books. Not just any books, but only the highest rated peer reviewed books!  

# Features

---

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?

 1. Search for texts books

2. Write, add, edit and delete a review.

3. Receive detailed information about textbooks searched

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?

-A link to each book will take me to a site where I can download/access the open textbook subject

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

Open Stax - provides open licensed, peer reviewed textbooks for free. Ability to download textbook. 

Open Textbook Library - provides open licensed, peer reviewed textbooks for free. Ability to download textbook. Download a spreadsheet that has all the textbooks available. 

OER Commons - Has all the same features as the other two sites but offers a feature listing the amount of textbooks available within a particular subject. 

# Design - Planning

---

*Optional but highly recommended*
*Please refer to this document:*

[Copy of Build Weeks: Planning & Design Worksheet (How to build a beautiful application)](https://www.notion.so/636a61e85061460b949a3452ddb1b035)

- What design system will you use?

- What will your user flow be? 

- What is the URL to your wireframes?

# Frameworks - Libraries

---

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?

Redux, Material-UI and Postgres.

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?

No.

- Are you required to pay to use the API?

No.

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)

No.

# For Data Scientists

---

- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.

- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.

- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)

- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

# Target Audience

---

- Who is your target audience? Be specific. 

Teachers with limited funding. 

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

This is an amazing idea!

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

N/A

## Research

---

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

# Prototype Key Feature(s)

---

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
